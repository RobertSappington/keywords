Keyword Development for Digital Marketing

This script creates author and title keywords by book genre from Amazon product data, transforming raw text into a form ready for upload to Amazon Advertising’s UI for book authors. At the time of code creation, the ad dashboard for authors limited ad campaigns to 1,000 keywords uploaded with ASCII encoding. Amazon’s product API provided data in UTF-8 encoding. These constraints, plus keyword format limits, drove requirements.

Data Source: Amazon’s product API (code not included).

Python Version: 3.6
